## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).\
  If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how you installed Rust on your system) to make sure you're running on the latest stable version.
